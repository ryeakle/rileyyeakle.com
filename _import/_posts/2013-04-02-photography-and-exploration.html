Taking a picture of something new every day is a great idea. Especially with the caveat that each picture must be of something different. It doesn't matter so much that the pictures are good, just that they're never of the same thing. This is one of those small changes that can have a big effect on yourÂ lifestyle by encouraging exploration and deviation from routine.

Photographers would probably tell you this, but I never believed it until I tried.
