That's right, November is National Novel Writing Month.  <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> is an awesome challenge to write a full-length 50,000 word novel in 1 month (30 days). It's not about writing well, just writing a lot. 1,667 words per day to be precise.

I attempted this 2 years ago and completed almost 2 whole pages! Yes, I was young and inexperienced back then, this time is for real.

Matt Cutts, an engineer from Google reveals what he calls "the secret" to NaNoWriMo in his TED talk, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html">Try Something New For 30 Days</a>.  "...The secret" he says, "is to not go to sleep until you've finished your words for the day".

NaNoWriMo comes but once a year. Time to become a novelist!
