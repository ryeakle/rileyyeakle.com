  <p>Engineers are generally poor at communicating what they do to others, which makes the field scary and mysterious. This can frighten off potential engineers and perpetuate misunderstandings about what engineering actually is.</p>

<p>This is &ldquo;not chill.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Engineers do really cool things. They make pretty much everything that distinguishes today&rsquo;s society from that of the paleolithic hunter-gatherers. How they make things is also amazing, like evaporating aluminum to make a single layer of aluminum on a surface to give it certain electrical properties. Unfortunately, engineers are very bad at communicating how and what they do to non-engineers. Most ideas and processes in engineering are so abstract, that they require a special vocabulary to describe in a non-verbose manner. Consequently:</p>

<p>(1) Engineers do sick-nasty awesome things but are generally unable to communicate effectively what they do to non-engineers.</p>

<p>Enter the graduating high school senior.</p>

<p>Upon applying for college, this senior will usually need to apply to a major, at least at the University of California campuses and probably most other state schools in the US. Usually for UC engineering, it&rsquo;s a pretty right fit to squeeze the engineering curriculum into 4 years. Switching into or out of a non-overlapping engineering major almost always damns students to 5 years as an undergraduate.</p>

<p>On top of this, most students don&rsquo;t take engineering classes in high school. Everyone takes English and math and science, so students know sort of what those are all about. At least those subjects are somewhat familiar. Engineering remains foreign.</p>

<p>(2) At the risk of spending another year in school, aforementioned high school student must choose her engineering major wisely, or change quickly once starting school to ensure she picks the right one.</p>

<p>Some schools provide guidance pages like Michigan State University does <a href="http://www.egr.msu.edu/future-engineer/what">here</a>, but their guide is only superficially deep. It has some good high level information on engineering disciplines, but not much more than that. It doesn&rsquo;t get deep enough to explain general problem solving techniques or adequately illustrate contemporary issues in engineering.</p>

<p>So, our high school student, Joanna Future-Engineer-McHollan has a problem. She wants to understand what engineering really is. She wants to know what contemporary issues engineers are tackling and what techniques and methods they use. Mike Curious&rsquo;s teacher said he should apply for an engineering major since he is good at math and science, but he&rsquo;s never really known what engineers do. Sharon Uncertain-Higgs-Possibly-Bryant doesn&rsquo;t even understand how awesome engineering is.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just limited to high school students though. Perhaps you are a computer engineer by trade and you desperately need your parents to understand that you don&rsquo;t fix computers. Or maybe, you are a dedicated engineering grad student and you know in your heart you could strike up so many bar conversations if only the people around you a knew a tiny of what engineering is about.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>An entertaining yet informative, easily accessible, massively viral e-book/print book entitled:</p>

<h3>WTF Is Engineering?: The Quintessential Guide</h3>
