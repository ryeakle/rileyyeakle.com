Ready for your daily dose of survivor bias?

![Nanowrimo Success!][nano]

The 'write your words before you go to sleep' strategy is the way to go. Â I actually ended up finishing a day ahead of time (Nov 29th ~midnight) due to some furious writing over the Thanksgiving weekend. Final word count: ~50,400 words. Is it the next great American novel? Nope. Am I proud of it? Well, some parts at least. Am I glad I did it? Hell. Yes.

Note: The editing time is huge because I left this word document open 
all the time. It's easier to work on things when they're in your
face. Actual writing time was closer to 60-75 hours.
