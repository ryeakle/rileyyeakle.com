Taking a picture of something new every day is a great idea. How good the pictures are doesn't matter.  
What does matter, is that they're never of the same thing. This small practice can have a big effect on 
yourÂ lifestyle by encouraging new explorations and deviation from routine.

Photographers would probably tell you this, but I never believed it until I tried.
