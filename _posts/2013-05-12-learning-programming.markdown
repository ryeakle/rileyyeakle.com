Friends often ask me, 
>I want to learn how to program, how can I learn how to program? What should I do to start?

My response is always the same. 

##What do you want to learn?
Is your goal to learn how computers work? We're not talking about webapps and all that so called 'high level' nonsense. 
We're talking about electricity pulses flowing through tiny channels of
semiconductor, shaped into a useful abstraction for computation. This is 
the level of computation that interacts with the real world, where physics 
isn't just a nebulous memory from high school.

Or perhaps you think the circuits people did a great job. In fact,
they did such a great job at building this foundational platform 
for abstraction that it would be a shame to put all that work to 
waste. You want to harness this power to quickly spin out solutions
to your problems with high level computation. Computers are like 
cars. Building them is certainly a worthy endeavor, but that's just 
the start. They're capable of so much more when you take them out 
for a spin, with all the power of that initial engineering behind you. 

These are two starting points for learning to program: low-level first 
and high-level first.

##If I knew more about programming, I'd know how to answer that
###Low Level Programming
'Low level' in computer science refers to programs that are closely tied to
the physical hardware of the computer. These programs are directly connected
to the computer's actual circuitry. You might tell the computer to read a 
voltage off of an input, or toggle the bits in a register. The low-ness means
the level of abstraction. The lower level the program, the more the code
you write will actually resemble the machine instructions.

###High Level Programming
'High level' means the level of abstraction is... high. The code you write 
looks nothing like the actual instructions the computer executes. This is because someone smarter than you figured out how to take more human-friendly
input and turn it into computer friendly instructions. 

For example, in a medium level of abstraction, to open a door, you might say
1. Approach door
2. Identify handle
3. Lift arm to door
4. Grab handle
5. Twist knob
6. Push door
7. Release handle

At a high level of abstraction, you realize that the procedure for opening
a door is well defined and you would simply say:
1. open door

At a low level of abstraction, you would go through the process of actuating
the muscles required to carry out the motions needed to perform the sub-tasks
needed to open the door.

##Low Level: Where Do Computers Come From?
If you want to know how computers actually work, or are interested in robotics,
this is a good place to start. I think the best way to get started with this
is with the Arduino microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are like tiny computers
without operating systems. You give them a program to run, and then they
run that program forever.

The tricky part about microcontrollers is that the learning curve usually 
looks something like this:

What makes Arduino cool though is that they've eased the learning curve
and lowered the barriers for entry into the world of microcontrollers.

The community for arduino is unbelievably strong, 

If this is the kind of thing you want to do professionally, you should 
transition to AVR or PIC microcontrollers. For hobbyist purposes, like
(link) automating your dog food, Arduino is great.
