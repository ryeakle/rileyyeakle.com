So far so good on <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> 2012. My word count is up to 13,785 words,  27% of the 50,000 word goal. Some strategies that have helped me keep up my momentum:

<strong>Write them words!</strong>

As a hard rule, I finish 1,667 words per day BEFORE I go to sleep (except for yesterday -___-).  It usually takes me around 2 hours to do this, so I never get too far behind. In NaNoWriMo, the only metric of success is word count, so get them words wrote!

<strong>Know the subject</strong>

By writing about a topic I know, (engineering!) it's easy to keep ideas about where the story should go next. I know what the characters involved are feeling and what the settings are like.  A few years ago I tried to write about amoebas, but I did not know anything about amoebas. This turned out to be disastrous.  This year, writing about engineering has been awesome, because I understand engineering. I do not understand amoebas.

<strong>About my NaNoWriMo Novel</strong>

Entropy is a story about a group of garage engineers who accidentally invent an unbelievable piece technology, and the ramifications of their discovery. This sounds a lot like Shane Carruth's masterpiece <a href="http://www.primermovie.com/">Primer</a>, a brilliant engineering fiction puzzle film. This is because I'm shooting for something that falls into the same sort of engineering fiction genre. Written in 30 days? That's how you know it's going to be good!
