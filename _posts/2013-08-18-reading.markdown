title: You Always Have Time To Read
category: posts

I have this habit of binge reading. I'll go months without reading for fun,
then blast through thousands of pages in a summertime frenzy. But, incremental 
reading works well too.

Micro-reading works like this: I carry around a book I enjoy reading. Then
when an opportunity arrives, I read it. Even in collegiate life these 
opportunities exist everywhere. There's always that time waiting for the bus, 
and those minutes before bed. And of course, the classic,
"It's too early to go to class, but too late to start working on something new."
Hell, Stephen King even does this. I read almost this exact paragraph last night 
in his book, _On Writing_. Apart from examples and publication status, 
the difference is he writes it better.

The key to micro-reading is that I keep my book instantly accessible. During
that 5 minute wait for a friend, reading needs to be easier than anything else. 
Otherwise I'll just swipe out emails on my phone or some shit like that.
