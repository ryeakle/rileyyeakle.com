title: You Always Have Time To Read
category: posts
---

I have this habit of binge reading. I'll go months without reading for fun,
then suddenly blast through thousands of pages in a summertime frenzy. 
Reading can also be incremental though. It's much more sustainable that way.

Micro-reading works like this: I carry around a book I enjoy reading. Then
when the opportunity arrives, I read it. These opportunities always
exist. There's that time waiting for the bus, and those minutes before bed.
The key is to always have a book I like. Otherwise I'll just swipe out 
emails on my phone or some shit like that.
