![Entropy Cover][entropy]

So far so good on <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> 2012. My word count is up to 13,785 words,  
27% of the 50,000 word goal. Some strategies that have helped me keep up my momentum:

###Write them words!

As a hard rule, I finish 1,667 words per day BEFORE I go to sleep (except for yesterday.) 
It usually takes me around 2 hours to do this, so I never get too far behind. In 
NaNoWriMo, the only metric of success is word count, so get them words wrote!

###Know the subject

By writing about a topic I know, (engineering!) it's easy to keep ideas about where the story should go next. 
I know what the characters involved are feeling and what the settings are like.  A few years ago I tried to 
write about amoebas, but I did not know anything about amoebas. This turned out to be disastrous.  This year, 
writing about engineering has been awesome, because I understand engineering. I do not understand amoebas.

###About my NaNoWriMo Novel

Entropy is a story about a group of garage engineers who accidentally invent an unbelievable piece technology, 
and the ramifications of their discovery. This sounds a lot like Shane Carruth's masterpiece 
<a href="http://www.primermovie.com/">Primer</a>, a brilliant engineering fiction puzzle film. This is because 
I'm shooting for something that falls into the same sort of engineering fiction genre.
