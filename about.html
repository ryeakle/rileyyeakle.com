  <p>
    I'm a masters student in Electrical Engineering at the University of
    California, San Diego working on underwater robotics with the Kastner
    Research Group. My main research interest is in approaching the problem of how we
    can use technology to better understand the planet and the environment.

    I earned my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Machine
    Intelligence at UCSD in 2014. During my undergraduate I led the Intelligent
    Camera Trap Project in the
    <a href = "http://e4e.ucsd.edu">Engineers for Exploration</a> program.
