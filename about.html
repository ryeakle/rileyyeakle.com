  <p>
    I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Machine Intelligence at Univeristy of California, San Diego in 2014. During my undergraduate I led the Intelligent Camera Trap Project in the <a href = "http://e4e.ucsd.edu">Engineers for Exploration</a> program. I went on to complete my masters degree in Electrical Engineering there in 2016, where I worked on underwater acoustic signal processing with the Kastner Research Group.

    I'm a now working at <a href = "https://guidebook.com"> Guidebook</a> where we make it easy to make your own app for organizing events. We're always looking for talented people to <a href= "https://careers.jobscore.com/careers/guidebook"> join our team</a>. In particular, I enjoy using distributed data processing technologies to help us improve our product. Beyond that, my interests vary widely, but problems which can't be solved deterministically are always my favorite. Outside of work I like hiking, cooking, and jamming legacy Magic: the Gathering games.
