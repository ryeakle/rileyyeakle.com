    I am a masters student in Electrical Engineering at the University of
    California, San Diego working on underwater robotics with the Kastner
    Research Group. My research interests
    span machine learning, embedded systems, and remote sensing. I completed my
    undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Machine
    Intelligence at UCSD in 2014. During my undergraduate I led the Intelligent
    Camera Trap Project in the
    <a href = "http://e4e.ucsd.edu">Engineers for Exploration</a> program.
